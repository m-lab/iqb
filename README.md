# Internet Quality Barometer (IQB)

The Internet Quality Barometer (IQB) is an open-source project initiated by [Measurement Lab (M-Lab)](https://www.measurementlab.net/).

IQB is motivated by the need to redefine how we measure and understand Internet performance to keep pace with evolving technological demands and user expectations. IQB is a comprehensive framework for collecting data and calculating a composite score, the “IQB Score”, which reflects the quality of Internet experience. IQB takes a more holistic approach than “speed tests” and evaluates Internet performance across various use cases (web browsing, video streaming, online gaming, etc.), each with its own specific network requirements (latency, throughput, etc.).
